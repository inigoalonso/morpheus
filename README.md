# About
This is a graphical tool for creating morphological matrices. It can be used to quickly create a matrix with "functional requirements" (FR) and "design solutions" (DS). New FRs and DSs can be created by clicking the "+ FR" and "+ DS" cells (the + DS cell is only visible after you have created your first FR).  You can attach images to any design solution by hovering over its cell and clicking the camera icon. To change the name of the matrix, simply click on the title and rename it to whatever you want.
